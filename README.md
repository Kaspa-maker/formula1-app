# BSc (Hons.) Level 8 - Assignment 1 - Single Page app.

Name: Kasper Gutkowski

## Overview.

The concept of the app is a fan based app for f1 and f2 and f3. I tried to create a place were fans can see their
favourite driver or read about a certain grand prix. You also can contact the devs using the emails provided and add news info 
and remove and edit them.

- Responsive Footer with links

## Setup.

Starting of I set up a folder were all the files would be stored. Once that was done I used creat app function in the cmd
that created and imported all the files necessary. Once the basic app was created the files necessary to create a single page app.
Once all the js files were created and storybook imported im procedded with coding.

## UI Design.

>> Shows the main page of of app. Clear view of the navbar and main image and intro to everyone visiting.

>> Shows the about page with the f1 image. It talks about who the devs our so the user can get a feel for who they are. It also shows contact details that a fan or potential worker can contact the team.

## Independent learning.

I used React-MDL and reactstrap to style my webpage. I used a tutorial online for CRUD adding, removing and editing. I also used stackoverflow for some code parts.
